export const INITIAL_TEXT = `The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat 
and blue eyes. They are large and muscular semi-longhair cats with 
a soft and silky coat. Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in 
the 1960s, they are best known for their docile and placid temperament 
and affectionate nature. 
The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the tendency of individuals from the 
original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.`;
